# QR Code Generator

This repository contains example React Native components used for a QR code generator application. The project currently includes an **ImageFullScreen** screen for displaying images in fullscreen with pinch-to-zoom support.

## ImageFullScreen Screen

`src/screens/ImageFullScreen.js` shows how to render an image fullscreen:

- Tap on an image in your detail view to navigate to this screen.
- Pinch to zoom and pan around the image.
- Tap once to toggle the header with **X** and **Download** buttons.
- Long press the image to open a modal with actions implemented using the `SettingsList` component.

This code serves as a template and may require additional setup (e.g., navigation and dependencies) to run inside your app.
