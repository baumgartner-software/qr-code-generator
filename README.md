# QR Code Generator

This repository contains a minimal [Expo](https://expo.dev) project for generating QR codes on the web.

The app uses `react-native-qrcode-svg` to render the QR code image.

## Getting Started

```
cd apps/frontend
npm install
npm run web
```

This will open the Expo development server in the browser.
